                                <h3>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Rage Quitting Problem...</h3>
                                <p>Like most fighting games, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero has a bit of a rage quitting problem. Part of that is due to the inherently unbalanced roster of 182 characters where some are naturally stronger than others, meaning you can put yourself at a disadvantage by going off-meta. However, most of the issue comes from people simply not being able to accept a loss. The rage quitting problem is one that affects players of all levels, including Twitch and Kick streamer xQC, who in this case, just happens to be the one rage quitting himself.</p>

                                <p>Qc isn’t exactly known for playing fighting games, but Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero has been part of his rotation as of late ever since it released. One of his clips made it to the Sparking! Zero subreddit, where other players watched him go off on people who were using “cheese” to win fights.</p>

                                <p>nless Zone Zero is collaborating with McDonald's to bring exclusive merchandise to Chinese locations. In the past, other HoYoverse games have partnered with popular food chains around the world, and now it's Zenless Zone Zero's turn.</p>

                                <p>Although it's only been a few months since Zenless Zone Zero launched, the title has already gained substantial popularity among gamers. Developed by the well-known HoYoverse has contributed to this rise in fame, and fans also appreciate Zenless Zone Zero for its story premise, extravagant characters, and adorable Bangboo companions. Zenless Zone Zero Version 1.3 will be released on November 6 with new S Rank characters Yanagi and Lighter, as well as new gameplay content and events. In addition to the update, some players will have a chance to get exclusive items thanks to the game's first collaboration with McDonald's.</p>

                                <h3>Fortnite Leaks Debut of Cars Characters</h3>
                                <p>Disney's Cars may be coming to Fortnite sometime soon, according to a leak. There have been plenty of different collaborations that take place in Fortnite and affect several game modes, but many of them seem to focus on Battle Royale gameplay. As Fortnite expands into an experience-based service that houses more than a single game, though, these collaborations may end up extending to parts of the title that could use the extra attention, ensuring that when players get tired of one Fortnite mode, they can just try out another part of the game and find a similar level of depth.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                Fortnite has been steadily amping up the scale of its collaborations, and the continued partnership the game has with Disney seems to be facilitating recent additions. Most recently, a batch of Disney villains were added to Fortnite as a part of the 2024 Fortnitemares event. With the Disney partnership alone, there's a giant library of media to choose from to get gamers hyped, and it appears that a unique pick may lead to crossover that goes beyond outside Battle Royale gameplay being released.

                                <h3>Honkai: Star Rail Leak Teases Important New NPC</h3>
                                <p>A new leak from Honkai: Star Rail is showing off an important NPC coming to the game, teasing a new member of the Astral Express. Alongside the HoYoverse sci-fi RPG's wide array of playable characters, the game features a plethora of important NPCs that players interact with regularly. Pom-Pom serves as one of Honkai: Star Rail's most noteworthy NPCs, acting as the conductor of the Astral Express, while the explorable worlds boast plenty of other important characters. Now, the Astral Express is set to see a new member added soon.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                The Astral Express serves as one of Honkai: Star Rail's most notable locations, being the player's main transportation between different worlds. Players receive two members of the Astral Express' crew as free characters early on in Star Rail, with March 7th and Dan Heng joining in the Trailblazer's adventures. Fans have also heavily speculated about future characters that may end up joining the interstellar railroad's crew, with Penacony character Sunday being a commonly-speculated new member. New leaks are now hinting at a brand-new Astral Express NPC with a tie to Honkai Impact 3rd.

                                <h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Drops to 'Mixed' Reviews on Steam</h3>
                                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has dropped to "Mixed" user reviews on Steam. While many Black Ops 6 players have used their Steam reviews to complain about technical issues with the game, there is no single reason that fully accounts for the shooter's unimpressive user scores on Valve's storefront.</p>
                                <p>
                                Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was released on Friday, October 25. Even before it became available to play, the 2024 shooter found itself at the very top of Steam's Top Sellers chart, where it remains as of October 26. And while Black Ops 6 has hence already proven to be a huge hit on Steam, its early player impressions are not universally positive, as underlined by the fact that the game has now dropped to "Mixed" reviews on the platform. This turn of events cannot be attributed to review-bombing, primarily because the shooter's negative user scores on Steam highlight a fairly wide variety of issues.

                                <h3>Silent Hill's Original Art Director Says He Was Worked Too Much to Get a Girlfriend</h3>
                                <p>Original Silent Hill art director and Pyramid Head creator Masahiro Ito has said he was too busy making Silent Hill games to get a girlfriend.</p>

                                <P>PC Gamer spotted a handful of X/Twitter posts from Ito who made clear that his time as a game developer wasn't all sunshine and daisies — and not just because he was working on the terrifying survival horror franchise.</P>
                                    
                                <p>For a four-year period between 1999 and 2003, Konami released Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2, and Silent Hill 3, and Ito was heavily involved in their creation.</p>

                                <P>"All the time I was attending my art university or was developing Silent Hill 1, 2, 3, and a cancelled title, I never had any girlfriends cause I had no time for it," Ito said. "I never thought I was a genius, but I was terribly competitive. The only way to beat geniuses is to give yourself up entirely to what you wanna accomplish."</P>
